# 👋 Hey there, I'm Dancan — Fullstack Developer 🧠 turned Cybersecurity Explorer 🔐

I build software like an engineer and break it like a hacker.

With a Diploma in Software Engineering and now studying Cybersecurity & Forensics at Open University of Kenya, I bridge the gap between code and cyber risk. I’m not just chasing certs — I document real breaches, reverse incidents, and explore both sides of the firewall.
